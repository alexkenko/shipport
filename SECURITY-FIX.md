# Environment Variables Security

## üö® CRITICAL: Rotate Supabase Keys Immediately!

The following Supabase credentials were found in your repository and have been compromised:

- **Service Role Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (truncated)
- **Project URL**: `https://xumhixssblldxhteyakk.supabase.co`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
2. **Generate new service role key**
3. **Update your environment variables** in Vercel/production
4. **Revoke the old key** (it's now public on GitHub)

## üîí SECURE ENVIRONMENT SETUP:

```bash
# .env.local (DO NOT COMMIT TO GIT)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-new-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-new-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-new-service-role-key
```

## ‚úÖ FILES CLEANED:
- Deleted scripts with hardcoded credentials
- Verified no other sensitive data in repository
- Confirmed proper environment variable usage in production code

**Your repository is now secure, but you MUST rotate your keys!**
