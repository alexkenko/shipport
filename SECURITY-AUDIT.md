# Security Audit Report

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

### 1. **HARDCODED SUPABASE CREDENTIALS** ✅ FIXED
- **Files Deleted**: 
  - `scripts/execute-all-asian-batches.js` 
  - `scripts/execute-important-ports.js`
- **Issue**: Service role keys were hardcoded in scripts
- **Status**: ✅ DELETED - No longer in repository

### 2. **SUPABASE URL EXPOSURE** ✅ SAFE
- **Files**: `app/layout.tsx`, `next.config.js`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Issue**: Supabase URL is exposed
- **Status**: ✅ SAFE - This is the public URL, meant to be exposed

## 🔍 SECURITY SCAN RESULTS

### ✅ **CLEAN - No Sensitive Data Found:**
- No API keys in source code
- No passwords in source code  
- No JWT tokens in source code
- No database credentials in source code
- No private keys in source code

### ✅ **PROPER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE USAGE:**
- Supabase credentials properly loaded from environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in production code

## 🛡️ **RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED:**

1. **Deleted vulnerable scripts** with hardcoded credentials
2. **Verified environment variable usage** in production code
3. **Confirmed Supabase URL exposure is safe** (public endpoint)

## ⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

**ROTATE YOUR SUPABASE KEYS NOW:**
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Generate new service role key
4. Update your environment variables
5. The old keys are now compromised and should be revoked

## 🔒 **SECURITY STATUS:**
- **Before**: 🚨 CRITICAL VULNERABILITY
- **After**: ✅ SECURE (after key rotation)

**Your repository is now secure, but you MUST rotate your Supabase keys immediately!**
